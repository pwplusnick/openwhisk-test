# Single Entrypoint Proxy

This is a repo to store single entrypoint proxy example test cases, such as Knative Serving. All single entrypoint execution environments should follow the contract this defined in the single entrypoint documentation.

The action code for each example is defined in the is directory, and the input directory has JSON files where the filename corresponds to the input for a the action code of the same file name. The output directory similarly has the expected output for that file.
